### Hi there <img src="https://github.com/kouniam/kouniam/blob/main/wave_emoji.gif" width="20px">

My name is Bruno and I'm a data scientist with a background in theoretical physics. I currently call Rotterdam my home. 
For the most part, I make use of Python to do mathematical modeling and data analysis, though I am no stranger to C, C++, MATLAB, SQL and R. 

My (pinned) repositories include some examples of scientific coding that I have done. Feel free to ask me about it.

- ðŸ”­ Busy doing data-sciency stuff most of the time.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on data pipelines for an asset management firm, strengthening my engineering skills.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kouniam/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kyunull) |
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him (proudly Queer :rainbow:)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a huge geek! I am a DnD DM for many years now, so rolling dice is part of my offline hobbies.
