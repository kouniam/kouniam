### Hi there <img src="https://github.com/kouniam/kouniam/blob/main/wave_emoji.gif" width="20px">

My name is Bruno Rodrigues and I'm a theoretical physicist. I am originally from Portugal, but call Rotterdam home. 
For the most part, I make use of Python to do mathematical modeling and data analysis.

You can find me on [![Twitter][1.2]][1], or on [![LinkedIn][3.2]][3].
