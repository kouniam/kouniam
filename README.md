### Hi there <img src="https://github.com/kouniam/kouniam/blob/main/wave_emoji.gif" width="20px">

My name is Bruno and I'm a theoretical physicist turned data analyst. I (currently) call Rotterdam my home. 
For the most part, I make use of Python to do mathematical modeling and data analysis, though I am no stranger to C, C++, MATLAB, SQL and R. 

My (pinned) repositories include some examples of scientific coding that I have done. Feel free to ask me about it.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking to start my career as a data analyst/scientist.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving my knowledge on Deep Learning algorithms.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him (proudly Queer :rainbow:)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a huge geek! If my curiosity drives me to a topic, I'll dig throught it relentlessly. âœ¨
